# Changelog

All changes to this library are documented here.

## 0.2

Refactoring and documentation.

### Breaking changes

**The `__construct()` API has changed! Review the docs before upgrading.** Rather than accepting an array of configuration parameters, each one is provided as a separate parameter. An additional paramter (`$authenticate`) allows you to choose whether the API authentication request should happen in the constructor.


## 0.1

Initial working release.
